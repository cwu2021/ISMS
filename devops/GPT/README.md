## Bing AI (GPT 3.5) generated market status.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce¹, Taiwan has one of the world’s highest per capita consumption rates of fresh fruit, consuming nearly **102 kilograms** per capita compared to the global **72 kilograms** per capita. Taiwan is a significant producer of fresh tropical fruits and local fruit production is of high quality. Local production meets approximately **88 percent** of total fruit demand and Taiwan typically only imports fruits not produced locally.

In 2020, Taiwan was the **eighth-largest destination** for U.S. agricultural exports, totaling $3.3 billion³. The United States is Taiwan’s top supplier of agricultural goods with **29 percent** market share³, followed by the EU27+UK with 12 percent¹. The best growth opportunities for U.S. suppliers include seasonal fruits for which Taiwan has no or limited production, such as cherries, strawberries, and blueberries¹.

Therefore, there is a chance to sell Taiwan fruits to Americans, especially if they are unique or exotic varieties that are not available in the U.S. market. However, the market may not be very large or profitable, as the U.S. already has a strong domestic production and import supply of fresh fruits. To succeed in the U.S. market, Taiwan fruit exporters would need to comply with the U.S. food safety and phytosanitary regulations, and actively engage in promotional activities that highlight the quality and nutritional value of their products¹.
