## Bing AI (GPT 3.5) generated market status.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce¹, Taiwan has one of the world’s highest per capita consumption rates of fresh fruit, consuming nearly **102 kilograms** per capita compared to the global **72 kilograms** per capita. Taiwan is a significant producer of fresh tropical fruits and local fruit production is of high quality. Local production meets approximately **88 percent** of total fruit demand and Taiwan typically only imports fruits not produced locally.

In 2020, Taiwan was the **eighth-largest destination** for U.S. agricultural exports, totaling $3.3 billion³. The United States is Taiwan’s top supplier of agricultural goods with **29 percent** market share³, followed by the EU27+UK with 12 percent¹. The best growth opportunities for U.S. suppliers include seasonal fruits for which Taiwan has no or limited production, such as cherries, strawberries, and blueberries¹.

Therefore, there is a chance to sell Taiwan fruits to Americans, especially if they are unique or exotic varieties that are not available in the U.S. market. However, the market may not be very large or profitable, as the U.S. already has a strong domestic production and import supply of fresh fruits. To succeed in the U.S. market, Taiwan fruit exporters would need to comply with the U.S. food safety and phytosanitary regulations, and actively engage in promotional activities that highlight the quality and nutritional value of their products¹.

## Start a presentation of growth hacking
`Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me today. I'm here to talk to you about growth hacking, a term that has become very popular in the tech industry in recent years. But what is growth hacking exactly? And how can you use it to grow your business or product?

Growth hacking is a process of finding the most effective ways to acquire and retain customers, using data, creativity, and experimentation. It's not about spending a lot of money on marketing or advertising, but rather about finding the best channels, strategies, and tactics that work for your specific audience and goals. Growth hacking is about being agile, flexible, and innovative, and constantly testing and learning from your results.

The term growth hacking was coined by Sean Ellis in 2010, who defined a growth hacker as "a person whose true north is growth". Ellis was the first marketer at Dropbox, and he helped the company grow from 100,000 to 4 million users in 15 months, using techniques such as referral programs, viral loops, and gamification. Since then, many other tech companies have used growth hacking to achieve massive success, such as Airbnb, Uber, Instagram, and Spotify.

But growth hacking is not only for tech startups. It can be applied to any business or product that wants to grow faster and smarter. In fact, growth hacking is more of a mindset than a set of tools or methods. It's about having a clear vision of what you want to achieve, and being willing to experiment with different ideas and measure their impact. It's about finding the best way to deliver value to your customers and make them happy.

In this presentation, I will share with you some of the principles and best practices of growth hacking, as well as some examples and case studies of successful growth hacks. I hope you will find this presentation useful and inspiring, and that you will be able to apply some of these ideas to your own business or product. Let's get started.`
