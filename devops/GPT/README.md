## Bing AI (GPT 3.5) generated market status.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce¹, Taiwan has one of the world’s highest per capita consumption rates of fresh fruit, consuming nearly **102 kilograms** per capita compared to the global **72 kilograms** per capita. Taiwan is a significant producer of fresh tropical fruits and local fruit production is of high quality. Local production meets approximately **88 percent** of total fruit demand and Taiwan typically only imports fruits not produced locally.

In 2020, Taiwan was the **eighth-largest destination** for U.S. agricultural exports, totaling $3.3 billion³. The United States is Taiwan’s top supplier of agricultural goods with **29 percent** market share³, followed by the EU27+UK with 12 percent¹. The best growth opportunities for U.S. suppliers include seasonal fruits for which Taiwan has no or limited production, such as cherries, strawberries, and blueberries¹.

Therefore, there is a chance to sell Taiwan fruits to Americans, especially if they are unique or exotic varieties that are not available in the U.S. market. However, the market may not be very large or profitable, as the U.S. already has a strong domestic production and import supply of fresh fruits. To succeed in the U.S. market, Taiwan fruit exporters would need to comply with the U.S. food safety and phytosanitary regulations, and actively engage in promotional activities that highlight the quality and nutritional value of their products¹.

## Start a presentation of growth hacking
`Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me today. I'm here to talk to you about growth hacking, a term that has become very popular in the tech industry in recent years. But what is growth hacking exactly? And how can you use it to grow your business or product?

Growth hacking is a process of finding the most effective ways to acquire and retain customers, using data, creativity, and experimentation. It's not about spending a lot of money on marketing or advertising, but rather about finding the best channels, strategies, and tactics that work for your specific audience and goals. Growth hacking is about being agile, flexible, and innovative, and constantly testing and learning from your results.

The term growth hacking was coined by Sean Ellis in 2010, who defined a growth hacker as "a person whose true north is growth". Ellis was the first marketer at Dropbox, and he helped the company grow from 100,000 to 4 million users in 15 months, using techniques such as referral programs, viral loops, and gamification. Since then, many other tech companies have used growth hacking to achieve massive success, such as Airbnb, Uber, Instagram, and Spotify.

But growth hacking is not only for tech startups. It can be applied to any business or product that wants to grow faster and smarter. In fact, growth hacking is more of a mindset than a set of tools or methods. It's about having a clear vision of what you want to achieve, and being willing to experiment with different ideas and measure their impact. It's about finding the best way to deliver value to your customers and make them happy.

In this presentation, I will share with you some of the principles and best practices of growth hacking, as well as some examples and case studies of successful growth hacks. I hope you will find this presentation useful and inspiring, and that you will be able to apply some of these ideas to your own business or product. Let's get started.`

## Here is a possible continuation of the story:
Jacqueline and Elena decided to test their skills and have some fun. They agreed to a friendly combat duel of might and magic. They went to a nearby field, where they drew a circle on the ground. They stood on opposite sides of the circle, ready to begin. They saluted each other and then launched their attacks. Jacqueline swung her sword and threw her shield, while Elena cast spells of light and air. They dodged and parried, trying to hit each other without hurting each other. They smiled and laughed, enjoying the challenge and the thrill. They were evenly matched, and neither could gain an advantage. They were about to call it a draw, when they heard a horn blowing in the distance. They stopped their duel and looked around. They saw a messenger riding towards them, waving a flag. He reached them and dismounted. He was panting and sweating, and his face was pale and worried. He said he had urgent news from the southern border. He said that scouts had reported that an orc army was marching closer for invasion! He said that the king had ordered all knights and soldiers to gather at the capital and prepare for war. He said that Jacqueline and her squad were needed immediately. He handed them a letter with the king's seal and then mounted his horse again. He said he had to deliver the message to other garrisons and then rode away. Jacqueline and Elena looked at each other with shock and concern. They knew that orcs were savage and ruthless enemies, who would stop at nothing to conquer and destroy. They knew that they had to join the king's army and fight for their kingdom and their people. They quickly gathered their gear and their squad, and headed towards the capital. They hoped they would arrive in time and make a difference. They hoped they would survive the war.`
