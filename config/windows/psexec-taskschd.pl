Gemeni: It appears the "Reboot" task within UpdateOrchestrator in Task Scheduler cannot be disabled due to permissions issues. To resolve this, you need to use a method that bypasses the standard user restrictions, such as running Task Scheduler as LocalSystem or modifying permissions directly using icacls.

 - Running Task Scheduler as LocalSystem: You can use a tool like psexec to launch Task Scheduler under the LocalSystem account, which has the necessary permissions to disable the task.

Important notes:
 - After modifying permissions or using psexec, you may need to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. 
 - Disabling the reboot task might cause issues with updates installing correctly, so it's important to understand the potential consequences. 
 - Consider delaying updates instead of completely disabling them to ensure you're running a secure system. 
 - Microsoft may re-enable the task after updates, so you may need to repeat the process periodically.
