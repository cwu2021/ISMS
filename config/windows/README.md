If you receiver a Blue Screen with a error message REGISTRY_ERROR bug, that indicates that a severe registry error has occurred. In other words something has gone wrong with the registry. This error may indicate that the registry encountered an I/O error while trying to read one of its files. This can be caused by hardware problems or file system corruption.
