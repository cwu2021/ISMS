# migrate from CentOS 8 to CentOS stream
<i> https://www.cyberciti.biz/howto/upgrade-migrate-from-centos-8-to-centos-stream-conversion/ </i>
<br> I decided to stick with CentOS Stream because I didnâ€™t have time or energy to install a new replacement such as Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux. Then restore data. It is too much work for my side project. Eventually, I will convert my legacy app to Docker format, but for now, I am going to upgrade my VM and save some time.
