# The most famous feature of MongoDB is its flexible data store because of its JSON-like document format.
# Another feature of MongoDB is that it offers an efficient way to search data with text, geospatial, or time-series dimensions. In addition, MongoDB includes features to analyse data, including support for multiple concurrent queries, indexing, and aggregation. Recent versions of MongoDB also include support for distributed, multi-document, multi-collection, multi-database, and multi-shard transactions with a high guarantee of data integrity.
