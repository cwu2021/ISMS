How big data is used for patrol planning
The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) tested the method under a controlled experiment. The project scientifically proved the model’s effectiveness. The city has a larger population and more complex patrol needs than Santa Cruz. Researchers established the experiment in the Foothill Division with a population of 300,000 people. They compared the predictive policing system with LAPD’s best practices.
