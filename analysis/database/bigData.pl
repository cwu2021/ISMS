Vs of Big Data: Velocity, Volume, Variety, and then Varacity and Value. 
 - Fixed volume can result in fixed cost, but high velocity with low variety or vice versa. High veracity and value can be achieved with good preprocessing for fixed volume.
(Gemini) IRB application is a document submitted to an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for review and approval of research involving human subjects. 
 - The IRB ensures the research adheres to ethical guidelines and regulations designed to protect participants. Essentially, it's a formal request for permission to conduct research that includes human subjects. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
 - Purpose: IRB applications are designed to ensure that research involving human subjects is conducted ethically and legally. 
 - Scope: These applications are required for research projects that involve interaction with or collection of identifiable private information from living individuals. 
 - Content: IRB applications typically include details about the research protocol, participant recruitment methods, data collection procedures, potential risks and benefits to participants, and measures to protect participant privacy and confidentiality. 
 - Review Process: The IRB reviews the application to assess the research's ethical soundness, ensuring that the study is designed to minimize risks, maximize potential benefits, and protect participant rights. 
 - Approval: Once the IRB approves the application, the research can proceed. Without IRB approval, research involving human subjects cannot begin. 
Key Components of an IRB Application:
 - Research Protocol: A detailed description of the research design, methodology, and procedures. 
 - Informed Consent Materials: Documents that explain the study to participants and obtain their voluntary agreement to participate. 
Recruitment Materials: Information about how participants will be identified and invited to join the study. 
 - Data Management Plan: Details about how data will be collected, stored, and protected. 
Risk Assessment: An evaluation of potential risks to participants and plans to mitigate those risks. 
 - Confidentiality and Privacy Protections: Measures to safeguard participant information and maintain confidentiality.
