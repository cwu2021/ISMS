## data analysis
Twenty-two cases from 1988/89 to 2000/01 were chosen for ERA-40 data composite, and 17 cases from 1998/99 to 2007/08 were chosen for TRMM data. Although the case numbers are different in these datasets, the composites of different variables exhibit characteristics that are mutually consistent. As demonstrated later, the difference in case numbers does not affect our results and interpretation of the major characteristics of the MJO in the Maritime Continent. Statistical significance test is then applied to the composites, and the patterns that are significant at the 0.1 level are highlighted in the following figures.

The Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis (JRA-25) (Onogi et al. 2007) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP–NCAR) reanalysis I (Kalnay et al. 1996), as well as Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) surface wind from satellite retrieval (Dunbar et al. 2006), were also used to verify the composite results of the 3D wind structure and 10-m wind retrieved from ERA-40 reanalysis data. The comparison reveals similar patterns among these datasets (not shown). It follows that the topographic effect revealed in the ERA-40 is also present in other reanalysis and datasets.
