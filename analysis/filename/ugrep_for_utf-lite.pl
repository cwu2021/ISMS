regular expression - How to grep characters with their unicode value ...
       It takes the same options as grep but offers vastly more features,
   such as: ugrep searches UTF-8/16/32 input and other formats. Option -Q
   permits many other file formats to be searched, such as ISO-8859-1 to
   16, EBCDIC, code pages 437, 850, 858, 1250 to 1258, MacRoman, and KIO8.
   ugrep matches Unicode patterns by default (disabled with option -U).
