# Why BGP is used over OSPF?
- If you would be conducting internal routing, as the routing within a site, company, or campus, you would be willing to use OSPF. BGP would be typically needed at a site edge, where you would be a route out to the public internet. If you are looking at building in-site with multiple homes, you would have to consider wishing to consider BGP.

# RealTek晶片爆零點擊RCE漏洞
SIP ALG是使網路封包由公有網路進入私有網路的NAT穿透技術。在此過程中路由器的SIP ALG模組會呼叫strcpy函式將SIP封包內容複製到預先定義的固定緩衝。最新漏洞主因出在廠商對這網路功能安全實作不當，使網路設備的緩衝對複製內容的長度檢查不足。駭客可以改造SIP封包內的SDP資料引數或SIP標頭，利用WAN介面傳送到路由器開採漏洞。成功的開採可造成緩衝溢位，引發裝置崩潰或遠端程式碼執行。https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/152508
