# Why BGP is used over OSPF?
- If you would be conducting internal routing, as the routing within a site, company, or campus, you would be willing to use OSPF. BGP would be typically needed at a site edge, where you would be a route out to the public internet. If you are looking at building in-site with multiple homes, you would have to consider wishing to consider BGP.
