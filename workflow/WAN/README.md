# Dynamic routing of friends' networks at home using BGP privately : building Intranets.

# Why BGP is used over OSPF?
- If you would be conducting internal routing, as the routing within a site, company, or campus, you would be willing to use OSPF. BGP would be typically needed at a site edge, where you would be a route out to the public internet. If you are looking at building in-site with multiple homes, you would have to consider wishing to consider BGP.

# RealTek晶片爆零點擊RCE漏洞
SIP ALG是使網路封包由公有網路進入私有網路的NAT穿透技術。在此過程中路由器的SIP ALG模組會呼叫strcpy函式將SIP封包內容複製到預先定義的固定緩衝。最新漏洞主因出在廠商對這網路功能安全實作不當，使網路設備的緩衝對複製內容的長度檢查不足。駭客可以改造SIP封包內的SDP資料引數或SIP標頭，利用WAN介面傳送到路由器開採漏洞。成功的開採可造成緩衝溢位，引發裝置崩潰或遠端程式碼執行。https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/152508

# Starlink Technology and Protocol
<i>https://www.starlink.com/technology</i><br>
Most satellite internet services come from single geostationary satellites that orbit the planet at 35,786 km. As a result, the round trip data time between the user and satellite—also known as latency—is high, making it nearly impossible to support streaming, online gaming, video calls or other high data rate activities.

Starlink is a constellation of thousands of satellites that orbit the planet much closer to Earth, at about 550km, and cover the entire globe. Because Starlink satellites are in a low orbit, latency is significantly lower—around 20 ms vs 600+ ms.

Each TVU receiver can utilize up to 20mbps of downstream bandwidth per live Pack feed. - A minimum of 2mbps upstream bandwidth per Receiver is required for all features to function efficiently.

Starlink Business users can expect download speeds of up to 350 Mbps and latency of 20-40ms, enabling high throughput connectivity for offices of up to 20 users, storefronts, and demanding workloads across the globe.

# iPhone 14 Will Have Satellite Connectivity. How Exactly It Will Work
Globalstar is operating a constellation of 48 satellites in LEO at 1414 km altitude. They are placed in eight orbital planes of six satellites, each with an inclination of 52°. This means they can provide service on Earth from 70° North latitude to 70° South latitude. Meaning the iPhone 14 satellite connectivity won’t work in polar regions.
