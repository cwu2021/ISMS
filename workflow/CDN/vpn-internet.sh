# SOCKS is a proxy server, and works similarly to a VPN. The proxy server is much faster than a VPN. The main difference is that the proxy server isn’t encrypted. The data is still hidden and secure though, but the only part that is encrypted is the initial access to the proxy server. It is recommended to use SOCKS5 if you want better security. Though, the best security will be through a VPN.

# OpenVPN Bad LZO decompression header byte: 69: The problem is that your server has comp-lzo adaptive in the config, but the client does not have compression enabled at all. So the client is sending uncompressed packets, while the server is expecting a compression header. Add comp-lzo to your client config file (adaptive is the default mode for comp-lzo, so you can omit that).
