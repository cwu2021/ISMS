### Conclusion
PERL is one of the more flexible tools that a security practitioner can learn. This paper has given a few examples of the power that PERL provides. PERL's extensibility allows a security practitioner to utilize a significant code base to rapidly solve problems that the security practitioner faces on a regular basis. PERL can help one create a quick solution to a smaller sized security problem, or can scale to a large security application that necessitates object oriented architecture.
